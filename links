Could you give me dashboard based subqueries that span these features :- Search – for keyword-based or filter-style queries (e.g., "containing bixby").

Trend – for temporal patterns (e.g., "Daily trend", "Monthly trend").
Distribution – for data spread (e.g., "distribution per day", "distribution per hour").
Top N – for rankings or limits (e.g., "Top 10 utterances", "Least 5 clients").
Big Number – for total count summaries (e.g., "total user count", "number of utterances"). for a particular dashboard query :- Show dashboard for Bixby TV utterance count
